		SplittingSolvers INSTALL PROCEDURE UNDER UNIX/LINUX/MACOS X.
		 TODO: this toolbox has not been tested under Windows.

1. PREREQUISITE

  a. Install the version .802 of WaveLab software package if it has not 
   been installed; check 
	http://www-stat.Stanford.edu/~wavelab/
   for installation instructions.

  b. Optional:

    - The SplittingSolvers toolbox uses the undecimated DWT code from DSP Rice 
    and the 2nd generation fast curvelet transform.
    These two transforms are included for convenience in this package in the UDWT and CURV subdirectory.
    Their mex files have been compiled for Unix Solaris/Linux/MACOS X.
    Please see www.dsp-rice.edu and curvelet.org for licence agreement.
    
    NOTE: the CurveLab wrapping functions (i)fdct_wrapping.m have been slightly modified from the original 
    to implement curvelets at the finest scale.
    
    - Some scripts also require SparseLab to be installed

2. UNPACK THE ARCHIVE 

  a. Copy SplittingSolvers.tgz to to the place you want the SplittingSolvers Directory to reside.

  b. Uncompress

     tar xfz SplittingSolvers.tgz

  c. After you uncompress the file for your machine, you should have
   the following directory structure:
    	SplittingSolvers
    	SplittingSolvers/1D/
	SplittingSolvers/2D/
	SplittingSolvers/Solvers/
    	SplittingSolvers/CurveletToolbox/
    	SplittingSolvers/UDWT/
	SplittingSolvers/TVdyadic/
    	SplittingSolvers/Utils/
    	   	

3. SET YOUR PATH
   a. Edit the file FastSolvPath.m, modify the line to your path:
	FASTSPARSESOLVERPATH = ['<AbsolutePathNameforSplittingSolversMainDirectory>'];

   b. Be sure that FastSolvPath executes each time you start Matlab by modifying your startup.m.
