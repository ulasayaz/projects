% Log Search algorithm
%
% [MVy MVx] = LogSearch(Block, img_ref, xc, yc, SearchLimit)
% finds the motion vector of the (yc, xc)-th Block in the reference image
% img_ref.
% 
% The search steps are log scaled: coarse step in the beginning and finer
% steps later.
% 
% Input:
% Block         - the current block being searched
% img_ref       - the reference image
% xc, yc        - (xc, yc) is the center coordinate of Block
%
% Output:
% [MVy MVx]     - the motion vector of Block
